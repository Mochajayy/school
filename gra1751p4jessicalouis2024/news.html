    <h2>RECENT NEWS ON SZA</h2>
    <hr>
<h2 id="h22">Presented by Live Nation, pgLang and Top Dawg Entertainment, the North American trek featuring the former TDE running mates is set to invade 19 stadiums across the continent next year.
      
      The exclusive Cash App Visa Card pre-sale starts on Wednesday (Dec. 4) at 10 a.m. local time on the Grand National Tour website, while the general public will have their chance at tickets on Friday morning (Dec. 6).
      
      
      The Grand National Tour is slated to kick off in Minnesota on April 19, and then rumbles through Houston, Atlanta, Charlotte, Philly, the New York area, Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Detroit, Chicago and Toronto before wrapping up in Washington, D.C., on June 18.
      
      Dot and SZA have collided in the past on tracks such as “Doves in the Wind” as well as “All the Stars.” They connected on Kendrick’s GNX album for a pair of collaborations in November, including “Luther,” which debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, and LP closer “Gloria.” The surprise album currently occupies seven of the top 10 slots on this week’s Hot 100, including Lamar’s third No. 1 hit of the year, “Squabble Up.”
      
    It’s been a banner year for Kendrick, and 2025 should be much of the same, with the Grammy Awards and his first stadium tour on tap.</h2>
